☁️ Create a VPC: You've taken your first steps by setting up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using Amazon VPC.




🥅 Create subnets: Moving deeper into your VPC, you created subnets, which act like neighborhoods within your city, each with unique access rules. You learned the difference between public and private subnets and set up a subnet to allow instances within it to automatically receive public IP addresses, making them accessible from the internet.




🚪 Set up an internet gateway: Lastly, you added an internet gateway to your VPC, acting as the main gate that allows data to flow in and out. This setup is essential for any applications that require internet access, such as web servers. You've configured the gateway and linked it to your VPC, ensuring your public instances can reach the outside world and vice versa.




🚏 Bonus - configure IP addresses and CIDR blocks: You've configured your VPC with an IPv4 CIDR block, understanding that IP addresses are like street addresses for your resources! You explored how different CIDR blocks dictate the size and scale of your VPC.
